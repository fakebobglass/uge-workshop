Hrm, what have i learned today. Well, its all just a rehash of the prework, which I know, repitition is a great way to get things to stick. But I can't help but feel like I'm wasting time. Or, I'm not learning ENOUGH. 

I'm sure I'll get to a point, hopefully soon, where I'll feel behind or overwhelmed. Then I can finally ask some questions. But until then, me, it's just you and, well, me.
